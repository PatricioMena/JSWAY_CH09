// Character inventory

// Improve the example RPG to add character inventory management according to the following rules:

//     A character's inventory contains a number of gold and a number of keys.

//     Each character begins with 10 gold and 1 key.

//     The character description must show the inventory state.

//     When a character slays another character, the victim's inventory goes to its vanquisher.

    this.strength = strength;

    this.gold = gold;
    this.key = keys;
